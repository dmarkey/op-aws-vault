# op-aws-vault üöÄ

A handy `aws-vault`-like utility built entirely on 1Password!

## ü§î What is it?

Ever wished `aws-vault` played nicely with 1Password? Or found the official 1Password AWS plugin a little... quirky? This tool scratches that itch! ‚ú®

It's a small Python script that mimics `aws-vault`'s core behavior but integrates seamlessly with your 1Password vault. It leverages the power of the 1Password CLI (`op`).

**Prerequisites:**
*   A 1Password account
*   The 1Password CLI (`op`) installed and configured
*   The 1Password desktop app running and unlocked

Tested and working on macOS, Linux, Windows, and WSL2! ‚úÖ

**Core Features:**
*   üîë Execute commands or open a shell with temporary AWS credentials (including MFA support!) for any role you can assume.
*   üåê Log in to the AWS Management Console via federation with a single command.

No more juggling configuration files! All settings ‚Äì AWS credentials, OTP secrets, and assumable roles ‚Äì live securely within your 1Password vault. Set it up once, use it everywhere! üåç

## üõ†Ô∏è How to install

1.  Create a Python Virtual Environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate # On Linux/macOS
    # .\.venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows
    ```
2.  Install using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install op-aws-vault
    ```

**Tip:** You might want to disable the 1Password AWS integration (`unalias aws` in your shell profile if needed) to avoid potential conflicts.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup in 1Password

Create a new **Login** item (or use an existing one) in 1Password and add the following fields with these exact labels:

*   `access key id` (Your AWS Access Key ID)
*   `secret access key` (Your AWS Secret Access Key)
*   `mfa serial` (Your MFA device ARN, e.g., `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/YourUser`. Recommended!)
*   `one-time password` (Link this to the TOTP secret for your MFA device)
*   `default-region` (e.g., `us-east-1`, `eu-west-1`)
*   `session name` (Optional: A custom name for the AWS session. Defaults to `op-aws-vault` if omitted)

**Adding Assumable Roles:**

For each AWS role you want to assume, add a **Text** field with the label following the pattern `role-{your-role-name}`. The value should be the full ARN of the role.

*Example:*
*   Label: `role-developer`
*   Value: `arn:aws:iam::987654321098:role/DeveloperRole`

Add as many roles as you need!

**Tagging:**

Finally, add the tag `aws-credentials` to this 1Password item. This is how `op-aws-vault` finds your configuration.

Your item should look something like this:

![Example Configuration](images/example.png "Example Configuration")

## üöÄ Usage

All commands require the `role` name as the first argument. This can be:
*   The name you defined after `role-` (e.g., `developer` from the example above).
*   `default` to use the base credentials directly (MFA will still be used if configured).

Expect 1Password to prompt for authentication periodically.

**Common Optional Arguments:**

*   `--region <aws-region>`: Specify the AWS region for the command (overrides `default-region`).
*   `--duration <duration>`: Set the session validity period (e.g., `15m`, `1h`, `8h`). Defaults to `1h`.

### `op-aws-vault exec` üíª

Opens an authenticated shell or runs a command with the specified role's credentials.

**Examples:**

*   Open your default shell with the `developer` role credentials:
    ```bash
    op-aws-vault exec developer
    ```
*   Run a specific command (`aws s3 ls`) with the `developer` role:
    ```bash
    op-aws-vault exec developer -- aws s3 ls
    ```
*   Open a specific shell (`/bin/bash`) with the `default` credentials:
    ```bash
    op-aws-vault exec default -- /bin/bash
    ```

Unlike the original `aws-vault`, `op-aws-vault` sessions can be safely nested if needed.

---

### `op-aws-vault login` üåê

Generates a federated login URL for the AWS Management Console and opens it in your default web browser.

**Example:**

*   Log in to the console as the `developer` role:
    ```bash
    op-aws-vault login developer
    ```

**Get URL Only:**

If you prefer to copy the URL instead of opening a browser, use the `--stdout` flag:
```bash
op-aws-vault login developer --stdout
```

Happy vaulting! üéâ
